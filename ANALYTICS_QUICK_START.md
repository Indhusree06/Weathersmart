# Analytics Dashboard - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What is the Analytics Dashboard?

The Analytics Dashboard is your personal wardrobe intelligence center. It helps you understand what you own, what you wear, and how to make better style decisions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Add Items to Your Wardrobe
Before you can see meaningful analytics, you need items in your wardrobe:
1. Go to **Wardrobes** page
2. Click **Add Item**
3. Upload photos and add details for your clothing items
4. Tag items with seasons, occasions, and weather conditions

### Step 2: Track Your Wears
The more you track, the better your insights:
1. When you wear an item, update its wear count
2. Mark when you last wore it
3. This data powers the "Most Worn" and "Least Worn" analytics

### Step 3: Save Outfits
Create outfit combinations:
1. Use the **AI Outfit Picker** to get recommendations
2. Save your favorite combinations
3. Mark special occasions
4. These appear in your Analytics dashboard

### Step 4: Access Analytics
Navigate to the Analytics page from any page:
- Click **Analytics** in the navigation menu
- Or visit `/analytics` directly
