# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user interface and authentication improvements for the Weather Smart application. The current implementation has React Hooks ordering issues, lacks proper logout functionality, and needs proper image storage management in Supabase buckets. These improvements will enhance user experience and ensure proper application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work without React errors so that I can use all features reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all React Hooks SHALL be called in the correct order before any conditional returns
2. WHEN a user navigates between authenticated and unauthenticated states THEN the application SHALL not throw Hook order errors
3. WHEN the component re-renders THEN all state management SHALL work consistently without errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to be able to sign out of the application so that I can protect my account and switch users

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN a sign out button SHALL be visible in the navigation
2. WHEN a user clicks the sign out button THEN they SHALL be logged out and redirected to the login screen
3. WHEN a user signs out THEN their session SHALL be completely cleared from the browser
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN they SHALL receive visual confirmation that the logout was successful

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and store images for my wardrobe items so that I can visually organize my clothing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN it SHALL be stored in the Supabase storage bucket
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN it SHALL be associated with the correct wardrobe item
3. WHEN a user views their wardrobe THEN uploaded images SHALL be displayed correctly
4. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the user SHALL receive clear error messaging
5. WHEN a user deletes a wardrobe item THEN associated images SHALL be removed from storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling throughout the application so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see specific error messages
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the user SHALL see appropriate retry options
3. WHEN image uploads fail THEN the user SHALL see clear error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to be consistent and intuitive so that I can easily move between different parts of the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the navigation SHALL show their email address
2. WHEN a user is on any page THEN they SHALL be able to access the main navigation
3. WHEN a user clicks navigation items THEN they SHALL navigate to the correct pages
4. WHEN a user is on a specific page THEN the navigation SHALL indicate their current location
